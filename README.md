# Game Lighthouse

## What is Game Lighthouse?
My software 'Game Lighthouse' seeks to provide video gamers with a web application that illuminates new quality games for them. Based on their inputted data and our algorithms, it generates recommendations that are highly likely to be enjoyable for the individual user.

## Installation Instructions  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   [Game Lighthouse Repo](https://github.com/brax-vesh/Braxton_Vescio_MAJOR_WORK-main/tree/master)
   
3. Navigate to the folder in your downloads.
   
4. Open up the folder in VS CODE and run the file Setup_DB.py

5. Check that the main.py file still contains a Twtich Client ID and Client Secret, this may be an issue with GitHub and API keys, and you may have to create your own Client ID and Secret at [Twitch's Site](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
   
7. Start using the application, begin with creating an account, navigate to the recommendation generator, and begin finding new games to play!

## How to Use  
Open the recommendation generator and enter game data into the input fields. Click the generate button, and the application will provide a list of games tailored to your preferences / game filters.
